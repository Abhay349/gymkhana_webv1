          <p><strong>Some journeys don’t end with graduation whereas they begin from there.</strong></p>

          <p>
            ‘Beyond the Batch’, an initiative by The Board of Technical Community (BTC), Gymkhana NIT Agartala,
            brings you the story of Rajkush Kumar Goswami, a trailblazer whose pursuit of innovation reminds us
            that passion doesn't graduate, it evolves.
          </p>

          <h2>Introduction</h2>

          <p>
            This podcast brings you a story which speaks about how a dynamic leader has grown from NITA’s classrooms
            to IIT Kanpur’s cutting-edge research. Despite being in his third year, he cracked the GATE exam, leading
            to entrepreneurial ventures and securing patents, a feat that was truly inspiring. The discussion begins
            with a warm welcome and an exploration of how his experiences at NIT Agartala shaped his career path and
            aspirations.
          </p>

          <h2>Doubts to Direction: How NIT Agartala Shaped a Dream</h2>

          <p>
            Despite choosing production engineering, often seen as a less prestigious branch, Raj was clear about his
            interest — a blend of engineering and management focused on technical innovation. This clarity became his
            compass.
          </p>

          <p>
            College reshaped his mindset, turning failures into feedback and setbacks into stepping stones.
            Behind this transformation stood mentors like <strong>Dr. Kishan Chris</strong> and 
            <strong> Professor Das</strong>, who fueled innovation and curiosity.
          </p>

          <h2>The E-Cell Journey</h2>

          <p>
            Surrounded by passionate seniors and startup enthusiasts, Raj found the perfect ecosystem to challenge his
            thinking. Joining E-Cell NIT Agartala wasn’t just an extracurricular activity — it was a turning point.
          </p>

          <p>
            Interactions with innovators from institutions like IIT Bombay expanded his perspective and solidified his
            love for entrepreneurship. Today, this journey fuels his pursuit of a PhD in deep-tech entrepreneurship.
          </p>

          <h2>Leadership Growth</h2>

          <p>
            As former E-Cell President, Raj led through challenges unique to the Northeast: limited resources, minimal
            startup exposure, and an untapped ecosystem.
          </p>

          <p>
            Under his leadership, E-Cell became a catalyst, connecting students with top incubators in Hyderabad and
            Delhi and sparking a campus-wide culture of innovation.
          </p>

          <h2>GATE: Where Purpose &gt; Pressure</h2>

          <p>
            Raj wasn’t chasing ranks or PSU placements. His goal was simple — clear the exam and keep doors open.
          </p>

          <p>
            With just 2.5 months of intense preparation, he cleared GATE not with the highest scores, but with
            clarity of purpose.
          </p>

          <h2>Internships: Curiosity as the Fuel</h2>

          <p>
            Raj emphasizes the importance of early internships. Explore startups in second year for agility, then
            shift to larger organizations in third year for structure and exposure.
          </p>

          <p>
            His ISRO internship stands out — during lockdown, he applied to the Semiconductor Lab with little hope,
            yet perseverance paid off.
          </p>

          <h2>The Innovation Blind Spot</h2>

          <p>
            Raj highlights one of India’s major blind spots — dependence on imported medical devices and advanced
            technologies.
          </p>

          <p>
            The journey from concept to product is long and demanding, but collaboration is the key.
          </p>

          <p>
            Encouragingly, companies like Samsung and Mercedes-Benz are now opening research hubs in India,
            strengthening the country’s R&D presence.
          </p>

          <h2>It All Started with a Pen and Ended with a Patent</h2>

          <p>
            Raj’s story began with a simple love for writing tools. He envisioned a vending machine that collects,
            recycles, and rewards used pens — turning waste into value.
          </p>

          <p>
            With support from a friend and a visionary professor, a ₹5,000 grant, and six months of effort, the idea
            transformed into a functional prototype worth ₹45,000.
          </p>

          <p>
            The result was a low-cost, patent-approved vending machine for Indian schools, featuring innovative
            mechanical and electronic design.
          </p>

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>

          <p>
            Raj urges dreamers not to rush to fix everything. Sometimes the best solution comes from pausing and
            breathing.
          </p>

          <p>
            His closing message:
          </p>

          <p className="font-semibold italic text-center text-lg">
            “The world may reward speed, but life rewards balance —  
            keep building, but don’t forget to breathe!”
          </p>
