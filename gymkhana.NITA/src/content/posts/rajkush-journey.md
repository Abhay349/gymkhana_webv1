**Some journeys don’t end with graduation whereas they begin from there.**

‘Beyond the Batch’, an initiative by The Board of Technical Community (BTC), Gymkhana NIT Agartala, brings you the story of Rajkush Kumar Goswami, a trailblazer whose pursuit of innovation reminds us that passion doesn't graduate, it evolves.

## Introduction

This podcast brings you a story which speaks about how a dynamic leader has grown from NITA’s classrooms to IIT Kanpur’s cutting-edge research. Despite being in his third year, he cracked the GATE exam, leading to entrepreneurial ventures and securing patents, a feat that was truly inspiring. The discussion begins with a warm welcome and an exploration of how his experiences at NIT Agartala shaped his career path and aspirations.

## Doubts to Direction: How NIT Agartala Shaped a Dream

Despite choosing production engineering, often seen as a less prestigious branch, Raj was clear about his interest — a blend of engineering and management focused on technical innovation. This clarity became his compass.

College reshaped his mindset, turning failures into feedback and setbacks into stepping stones. Behind this transformation stood mentors like **Dr. Kishan Chris** and **Professor Das**, who fueled innovation and curiosity.

## The E-Cell Journey

Surrounded by passionate seniors and startup enthusiasts, Raj found the perfect ecosystem to challenge his thinking. Joining E-Cell NIT Agartala wasn’t just an extracurricular activity — it was a turning point.

Interactions with innovators from institutions like IIT Bombay expanded his perspective and solidified his love for entrepreneurship. Today, this journey fuels his pursuit of a PhD in deep-tech entrepreneurship.

## Leadership Growth

As former E-Cell President, Raj led through challenges unique to the Northeast: limited resources, minimal startup exposure, and an untapped ecosystem.

Under his leadership, E-Cell became a catalyst, connecting students with top incubators in Hyderabad and Delhi and sparking a campus-wide culture of innovation.

## GATE: Where Purpose > Pressure

Raj wasn’t chasing ranks or PSU placements. His goal was simple — clear the exam and keep doors open.

With just 2.5 months of intense preparation, he cleared GATE not with the highest scores, but with clarity of purpose.

## Internships: Curiosity as the Fuel

Raj emphasizes the importance of early internships. Explore startups in second year for agility, then shift to larger organizations in third year for structure and exposure.

His ISRO internship stands out — during lockdown, he applied to the Semiconductor Lab with little hope, yet perseverance paid off.

## The Innovation Blind Spot

Raj highlights one of India’s major blind spots — dependence on imported medical devices and advanced technologies.

The journey from concept to product is long and demanding, but collaboration is the key.

Encouragingly, companies like Samsung and Mercedes-Benz are now opening research hubs in India, strengthening the country’s R&D presence.

## It All Started with a Pen and Ended with a Patent

Raj’s story began with a simple love for writing tools. He envisioned a vending machine that collects, recycles, and rewards used pens — turning waste into value.

With support from a friend and a visionary professor, a ₹5,000 grant, and six months of effort, the idea transformed into a functional prototype worth ₹45,000.

The result was a low-cost, patent-approved vending machine for Indian schools, featuring innovative mechanical and electronic design.

## Conclusion

Raj urges dreamers not to rush to fix everything. Sometimes the best solution comes from pausing and breathing.

His closing message:

*“The world may reward speed, but life rewards balance — keep building, but don’t forget to breathe!”*
